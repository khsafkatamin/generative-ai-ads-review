## 🧠 Overview

This document presents a high-level literature review titled  
**“Generative AI and Foundation Models in Automated Driving.”**

It explores how recent advances in generative models and foundation architectures are shaping the development of automated driving systems (ADS). The review is structured around two core paradigms of automated vehicle development:

- **📦 Offline Processing**  
  Covers data generation, labeling, 3D scene reconstruction, and simulation tasks using foundation models.
  
- **🚗 On-Vehicle Execution**  
  Focuses on real-time assistance and decision-making enabled by foundation models.

## 📚 Purpose

This is a self-initiated, exploratory research project aimed at:

- Synthesizing recent developments in the field  
- Understanding the integration of generative AI in ADS pipelines  
- Identifying opportunities and challenges in applying foundation models to automated driving

⚠️ **Note:** This is a **preliminary**, high-level investigation. The review currently summarizes key trends and selected works. I plan to expand it with more in-depth technical analysis, detailed comparisons, and broader coverage in future iterations.
